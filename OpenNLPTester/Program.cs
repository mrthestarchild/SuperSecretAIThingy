There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.<ref></ref> Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to establish a Perpetual Union/perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for ratification.<ref name=Milkis />  Under the Articles, which Coming into force/took effect on March 1, 1781, the Congress of the Confederation was a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.<ref name=Kelly /> This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of The Crown/Crown and Parliament of Great Britain/Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.<ref name=Kelly /> The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a President of the Continental Congress/president of the United States in Congress Assembled to preside over its deliberation as a neutral discussion moderator. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position without much influence.<ref></ref>  In 1783, the Treaty of Paris (1783)/Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.<ref name=Milkis /> By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean Sea/Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North African Barbary pirates/pirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.<ref name=Milkis /> Civil and political unrest loomed.  Following the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the Annapolis Convention (1786)/convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, Alexander Hamilton led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washingtons attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.<ref name=Milkis /><ref name=Beeman></ref>  When the Constitutional Convention (United States)/Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (Rhode Island did not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.<ref name=Milkis /> New York (state)/New York offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.<ref name=Milkis /> It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the United States Constitution/U.S. Constitution emerged.  == Powers and duties ==   === Article I legislative role === File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg/alt=/thumb/President Lyndon B.

The Presentment Clause requires that any Bill (law)/bill passed by United States Congress/Congress must be presented to the president before it can become law. Once the legislation has been presented, the president has three options: # Sign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundaysthe bill Coming into force/becomes law. # Veto#United States/Veto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objectionsthe bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a Supermajority#Two-thirds vote/two-thirds vote. # Take no action on the legislation within the above timeframethe bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law (a pocket veto). In 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the presidents veto power with the Line Item Veto Act of 1996/Line Item Veto Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In Clinton v. City of New York, , the Supreme Court of the United States/U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.  The president can also be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting or even insisting that Congress enact laws he believes are needed. Additionally, he can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.<ref></ref> Presidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.<ref></ref> Vesting Clauses/Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution, bolstered by Necessary and Proper Clause/Article I, Section 8, puts all Right of initiative (legislative)/lawmaking power in Congresss hands, and Ineligibility Clause/Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress.  The president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally (e.g. Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 3: Presidential responsibilities/Article II, Section 3) or statutorily mandated periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today the greatest in importance is given as the oral State of the Union addresses, which often outline the presidents legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.<ref></ref>  In the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of List of United States federal agencies/agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a virtual army of czars – each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House.<ref name=tws28sep08></ref> Presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.<ref name=tws04oct08></ref> This practice has been criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional.<ref name=tws11nov301></ref> Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an increasingly swollen executive branch and the eclipse of Congress.<ref name=tws28sep></ref>  === Article II executive powers === File:FordNixonBushReaganCarter.jpg/alt=/thumb/Presidents Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, George H.

One of the most important of executive powers is the presidents role as Powers of the president of the United States#Commander-in-chief/commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.<ref></ref>  The amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied greatly.<ref>Andrew J. Polsky, Elusive Victories: The American Presidency at War (Oxford University Press, 2012) [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=37003 online review]</ref> George Washington, the first U.S. president, firmly established civilian control of the military/military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebellion—a conflict in western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay an excise tax on spirits. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was the first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field, though James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in Burning of Washington/defense of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812.<ref></ref> Abraham Lincoln was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the American Civil War, 1861–1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant.<ref>James M. McPherson, Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln As Commander in Chief (2009)</ref>  The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the United States Department of Defense/Department of Defense and is normally exercised through the United States Secretary of Defense/secretary of defense.

Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war,<ref name=tws12novef></ref><ref name=tws8nov102></ref> but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelts military move into Panama in 1903,<ref name=tws12novef /> the Korean War,<ref name=tws12novef /> the Vietnam War,<ref name=tws12novef /> and the invasions of Grenada in 1983<ref name=tws8nov101></ref> and Panama in 1989.<ref name=tws8nov100></ref>  The Constitution also empowers the president to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a two-thirds majority vote), become binding with the force of federal law.  ==== Administrative powers ====  (William Rehnquist/Rehnquist, J., Dissenting opinion/dissenting)}} The president is head of the executive branch of the federal government and is Take Care Clause/constitutionally obligated to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.<ref></ref> The executive branch has over four million employees, including the military.<ref></ref>  Presidents make numerous executive branch appointments: an incoming president may make up to 6,000 before taking office and 8,000 more while serving. Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet of the United States/Cabinet, and other federal officers, are all appointed by a president with the United States Senate#Checks and balances/advice and consent of a majority of the Senate. When the Senate is in recess for at least ten days, the president may make recess appointments.<ref>NLRB v. Noel Canning, 572 U.S. __ (2014).</ref> Recess appointments are temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the Senate.  The power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials purely at will.<ref>Shurtleff v. United States, ; Myers v. United States, .</ref> However, Congress can curtail and constrain a presidents authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute.<ref>Humphreys Executor v. United States,  and Morrison v. Olson, , respectively.</ref>  To manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Within the Executive Office, the presidents innermost layer of aides (and their assistants) are located in the White House Office.  To allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning Congress/Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution to call a special session of one or both houses of Congress. Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. Harry Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948 (the so-called Turnip Day Session). In addition, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution/Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly United States presidential inauguration/inaugurated presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this administrative power.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  The president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government through issuing various types of directives, such as Presidential proclamation (United States)/presidential proclamation and Executive order (United States)/executive orders. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.<ref></ref> Even so, these directives are subject to Judicial review in the United States/judicial review by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional. Moreover, Congress can overturn an executive order through legislation (e.g., Congressional Review Act).  ==== Juridical powers ==== The president has power to nominate United States federal judge/federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Advice and consent#United States/Senate confirmation before they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to United States district court/U.S. district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial courtesy. Presidents may also grant pardons and Pardon#Related concepts/reprieves. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office; this is often Controversy/controversial.<ref name=tws8nov12></ref><ref name=tws8nov11></ref><ref name=tws8nov10></ref>   Two doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice of the United States/Chief Justice John Jays notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Kingdom of Great Britain/Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washingtons action created the precedent for the privilege. When Richard Nixon/Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, , that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President Bill Clinton/Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, , that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the Precedent/legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.<ref></ref>  The state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from Discovery (law)/discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron Burr and again in Totten v. United States , when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.<ref></ref> However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until United States v. Reynolds , where it was held to be a common law Evidence (law)/evidentiary privilege.<ref name=ACS></ref> Before the September 11 attacks, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.<ref></ref> Since 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit/Ninth Circuits ruling in Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.<ref name=ACS /><ref></ref><ref></ref> Critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  === Ceremonial roles === File:Wilson opening day 1916.jpg/thumb/President Woodrow Wilson throws out the ceremonial first ball on Opening Day, 1916 The president fulfills many ceremonial duties. William Howard Taft started the tradition of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium, Washington, D.C., on the Minnesota Twins#Washington Nationals/Senators: 1901–1960/Washington Senatorss Opening Day. Every president since Taft, except for Jimmy Carter, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game/All-Star Game, or the World Series, usually with much fanfare.<ref></ref> Every president since Theodore Roosevelt has served as honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America.<ref></ref>  Other presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House White House Easter Egg Roll/egg rolling for local children.<ref></ref> Beginning in 1947, during the Harry S. Truman administration, every Thanksgiving (United States)/Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of pardoning the turkey was formalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.<ref name=Hesse></ref>  Presidential traditions also involve the presidents role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since James Buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the United States presidential transition/presidential transition.<ref></ref> Ronald Reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on Inauguration Day for the incoming president.<ref></ref>   During a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State visits to the United States/State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.<ref></ref> This is followed by a White House State Dinner/state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room of the White House/State Dining Room later in the evening.<ref name=The White House State Dinner></ref>  The modern presidency holds the president as one of the nations premier celebrities.

To serve as president, one must: * be a Natural-born-citizen clause/natural-born citizen of the United States; * be at least thirty-five years old; * be a Residency (domicile)#United States/resident in the United States for at least fourteen years.<ref></ref>  A person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions: * Under the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution/Twenty-second Amendment, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.<ref></ref><ref></ref> * Under Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction/Article I, Section 3, Clause 7, upon conviction in impeachment cases, the Senate has the option of disqualifying convicted individuals from holding federal office, including that of president.<ref></ref> * Under Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion/Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, can become president. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.<ref></ref>  === Campaigns and nomination ===  The modern presidential campaign begins before the United States presidential primary/primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their United States presidential nominating convention/national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the partys nominee for president. Typically, the partys presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is Rubber stamp (politics)/rubber-stamped by the convention. The most common previous profession of U.S. presidents is lawyer.<ref>International Law, US Power: The United States Quest for Legal Security, p 10, Shirley V.

Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions. Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives.  === Election === File:Electoral map 2012-2020.svg/thumb/upright=1.33/Map of the United States showing the number of electoral votes allocated following the 2010 United States Census/2010 census to each U.S. state/state and the District of Columbia for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 presidential elections; it also notes that Maine and Nebraska distribute electors by way of the Congressional District Method. 270 electoral votes are required for a majority out of 538 votes possible.   The president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution/Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.<ref></ref> Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election held on Election Day (United States)/Election Day.<ref name=CRS2017THN></ref> In all but two states, the party whose presidential-vice presidential Ticket (election)/ticket receives a Plurality (voting)/plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire Slate (elections)/slate of elector nominees chosen as the states electors.<ref></ref> Maine and Nebraska deviate from this  practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each List of United States congressional districts/congressional district.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  On the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the Political parties in the United States/party that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 30 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are promise/pledged.<ref name=CRS2017THN/><ref></ref> Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an absolute majority of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the United States House of Representatives/House of Representatives must meet to elect a president using a contingent election procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top electoral vote-getters for president. For a candidate to win, he or she must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).<ref name=CRS2017THN/>  There have been two contingent presidential elections in the nations history. A 73–73 electoral vote tie between Thomas Jefferson and fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr in the 1800 United States presidential election/election of 1800 necessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors/Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 of the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the  would become vice president.<ref></ref> On February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr became vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the 1804 United States presidential election/1804 election.<ref name=HF-XII></ref> A quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the 1824 United States presidential election/election of 1824. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H. Crawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.<ref></ref>  == Tenure == === Inauguration ===  Pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution/Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and vice president begins at noon on January 20.<ref></ref> The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as United States presidential inauguration/Inauguration Day, were the Second inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt/second terms of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937.<ref name=HHistory1201937></ref> Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933–37) of both men had been shortened by  days.<ref name=GPOCONAN20171021></ref>  Before executing the powers of the office, a president is required to Recitation/recite the Oath of office of the President of the United States/Presidential Oath of Office, found in Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 8: Oath or affirmation/Article II, Section 1, Clause 8 of the Constitution. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:  </ref>}}  Presidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a Bible while taking the oath, and have added So help me God to the end of the oath.<ref></ref><ref></ref> Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the Chief Justice of the United States/chief justice of the United States.<ref name=VK218/>  === Term limit === When the first president, George Washington, announced in his George Washingtons Farewell Address/Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a two-terms then out precedent. Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe.<ref name=TermsTenure></ref> In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S. Grant sought a non-consecutive third term in 1880,<ref></ref> as did Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 (though it would have been only his second full term).<ref></ref> Both were unsuccessful.  File:FDR in 1933.jpg/thumb/left/upright=.90/Franklin D. Roosevelt won a record four United States presidential election/presidential elections (1932, 1936, 1940 and 1944). In 1940, after leading the nation through the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the self-imposed precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in World War II, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.<ref name=22ndAPPC></ref>  In response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelts presidency, the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution/Twenty-second Amendment was ratification/adopted in 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another presidents four-year term. Harry S. Truman, president when this term limit came into force, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full term—to which he would have otherwise been ineligible for election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelts fourth term—before he withdrew from the 1952 United States presidential election/1952 election.<ref name=22ndAPPC/>  Since the amendments adoption, five presidents have served two full terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Both Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush sought a second term but were defeated. Richard Nixon was elected to a second term, but resigned before completing it. Lyndon B. Johnson, having held the presidency for one full term in addition to only 14 months of John F. Kennedys unexpired term, was eligible for a second full term in 1968, but Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968#Johnson withdraws/withdrew from Democratic Primary. Additionally, Gerald Ford, who served out the last two years and five months of Nixons second term, sought a full term but was defeated by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 United States presidential election/1976 election.  === Impeachment ===  Article Two of the United States Constitution#Section 4: Impeachment/Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Speaker and other officers; Impeachment/Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a grand jury with the power to Impeachment/impeach said officials by a majority vote.<ref name=A1essaySBP></ref> Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Trial of Impeachments/Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 authorizes the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.<ref></ref>  Two presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in Impeachment of Andrew Johnson/1868, and Bill Clinton in Impeachment of Bill Clinton/1998. Both were acquitted by the Senate: Johnson by one vote, and Clinton by 17 votes. Additionally, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary/House Judiciary Committee commenced impeachment proceedings against Richard Nixon in impeachment process against Richard Nixon/1974; however, he resigned from office before the full House voted on the articles of impeachment.<ref name=A1essaySBP/>  == Succession and disability == Vacancies and succession in the office of president may arise under several possible circumstances: death, resignation, and Impeachment in the United States#Senate/removal from office. Deaths have occurred a number of times, a resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.  The Constitution, in Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 6: Vacancy and disability/Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, stipulates that the vice president takes over the powers and duties of the presidency in the event of a presidents removal, death, resignation, or inability.<ref name=FordhamLaw2011></ref> Even so, it does not clearly state whether the vice president would become president of the United States or simply Acting (law)/act as president in a case of succession.<ref name=ArticleIIessays></ref> This ambiguity was alleviated in 1967 by Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 1: Presidential succession/Section 1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, which unequivocally states that the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president.  Under Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 3: Presidential declaration/Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes Acting President of the United States/acting president, by transmitting a statement to the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives/Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the United States Senate/president pro tempore of the Senate stating the reasons for the transfer. The president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting, to those two officials, a written declaration stating that resumption. Such a transfer of power has occurred on three occasions: Ronald Reagan to George H. W. Bush once, on July 13, 1985, and George W. Bush to Dick Cheney twice, on June 29, 2002, and on July 21, 2007.<ref></ref>  Under Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Section 4: Vice Presidential–Cabinet declaration/Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the vice president, in conjunction with a majority of the Cabinet of the United States/Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate that the president is Capacity (law)/incapacitated—unable to discharge their presidential powers and duties. If this occurs, then the vice president will assume the presidential powers and duties as acting president; however, the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties. If the vice president and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to decide the merit of the claim.  Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President.<ref name=ArticleIIessays/> The Presidential Succession Act of 1947, (codified as ) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the United States presidential line of succession/presidential line of succession follows the order of: Speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of United States federal executive departments/federal executive departments who form the presidents Cabinet of the United States/Cabinet. The Cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those department heads who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.<ref></ref>  == Political affiliation == Political party/Political parties have dominated Politics of the United States/American politics for most of the nations history. Though the Founding Fathers of the United States/Founding Fathers generally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from political factions, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the Presidency of George Washington/Washington administration were referred to as pro-administration and would eventually form the Federalist Party, while those in opposition joined the emerging Democratic-Republican Party.<ref></ref>  Greatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained Independent politician/unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.<ref name=GWpps></ref><ref></ref> Since George Washington, 43 persons have been sworn into the office of president, and each has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office. The number of presidents per political party (at the time of entry into office) are:<ref></ref><ref></ref>  {/ class=wikitable /- ! colspan=2/ Party ! <abbr title=Number of presidents>#</abbr> !

The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the Presidents Palace, the Presidents House, and the Executive Mansion. Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.<ref></ref> Facilities that are available to the president include access to the White House staff, medical care, recreation, housekeeping, and security services. The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food.<ref></ref>  Camp David, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, a mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, is the presidents country residence.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the Boeing C-32, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight.<ref name=af1>. White House Military Office. Retrieved June 17, 2007.</ref><ref>Any United States Air Force/U.S. Air Force aircraft carrying the president will use the call sign Air Force One. Similarly, Navy One, Army One, and Coast Guard One are the call signs used if the president is aboard a craft belonging to these services. Executive One becomes the call sign of any civilian aircraft when the president boards.</ref>  For short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of United States Marine Corps/U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models, designated Marine One when the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the president is actually aboard to any would-be threats.  For ground travel, the president uses the Presidential state car (United States)/presidential state car, which is an armored limousine designed to look like a Cadillac sedan, but built on a truck chassis.<ref name=USSSPRL>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090118094400/http://www.secretservice.gov/press/GPA02-09_Limo.pdf New Presidential Limousine enters Secret Service Fleet] U.S. Secret Service Press Release (January 14, 2009) Retrieved on January 20, 2009.</ref><ref name=CNN20090106></ref> The United States Secret Service/US Secret Service operates and maintains the fleet of several limousines.

As part of their protection, presidents, First Lady of the United States/first ladies, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames.<ref name=junior></ref> The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition.<ref name=cbs-codenames></ref>  == Post-presidency == File:Five_Presidents_Oval_Office.jpg/upright=1.2/thumb/right/Four presidents and one then-president-elect. From left to right: George H. W. Bush, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter. Photo taken in the Oval Office on January 7, 2009; Obama formally took office thirteen days later. Under the Former Presidents Act, all living former presidents are granted a pension, an office, and a staff. The pension has increased numerous times with Congressional approval. Retired presidents now receive a pension based on the salary of the current administrations cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 each year in 2012.<ref></ref> Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect congressional pensions.<ref></ref> The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and franking privileges. Prior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the presidents death.<ref></ref><ref></ref> In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.<ref name=secretservice.gov></ref> On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent presidents.<ref></ref> A spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.<ref name=secretservice.gov />  Some presidents have had significant careers after leaving office. Prominent examples include William Howard Tafts tenure as Chief Justice of the United States and Herbert Hoovers work on government reorganization after World War II. Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for seventeen years, and Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875. John Tyler served in the provisional Congress of the Confederate States during the American Civil War/Civil War and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives, but died before that body first met.  Presidents may use their predecessors as emissaries to deliver private messages to other nations or as official representatives of the United States to state funerals and other important foreign events.<ref name=apreaction19810331></ref><ref name=4presidentsphotos></ref> Richard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.<ref>, The White House.</ref> Jimmy Carter has become a global human rights campaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Bill Clinton has also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, from North Korea. Clinton has also been active politically since his presidential term ended, working with his wife Hillary Clinton/Hillary on her Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008/2008 and Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016/2016 presidential bids and President Obama on his Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012/2012 reelection campaign.  As of September 2019, there are four Living Presidents of the United States/living former U.S. presidents. The most recent former president to die was George H. W. Bush (1989–1993), on November 30, 2018. The living former presidents, in order of service, are:  <gallery widths=150px heights=170px class=center> File:Carter 2k14.tif/}} File:Clinton 2k15.tif/}} File:Bush 2k14.tif/}} File:Barack Obama in October 2016.jpg/}} </gallery>  === Presidential libraries ===  File:Seal of the US Presidential Libraries.svg/frameless/left/upright=0.6 Every president since Herbert Hoover has created a Institutional repository/repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.<ref></ref> There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, such as the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the State of Illinois, the George W. Bush Presidential Center/George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Southern Methodist University, the George Bush Presidential Library/George H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Texas A&M University, and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum/Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the University of Texas at Austin.  A number of presidents have lived for many years after leaving office, and several of them have personally overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some have even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document, including the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home in Abilene, Kansas, Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California, and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. These gravesites are open to the general public.  == See also ==  * Curse of Tippecanoe * List of United States presidential trips * Presidential $1 Coin Program * Presidential M&Ms * Second-term curse  == References == Footnotes   Citations   == Further reading ==  * Balogh, Brian and Bruce J.
